# ConversationAssigned Event Handling - Fixed

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Backend Data Inconsistency** ✅
**Problem**: The backend was sending different payloads for `ConversationAssigned` events to different groups (agent vs conversation).

**Solution**: 
- Updated `ChatController.cs` to send consistent, complete payload to both agent and conversation groups
- Added missing agent and customer information in the payload
- Standardized field names and structure

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/ChatRuntimeService/Controllers/ChatController.cs`
- `backend/src/LiveAgentService/Hubs/AgentHub.cs`

### 2. **Frontend Data Mapping Issues** ✅ 
**Problem**: Frontend applications were not properly handling the ConversationAssigned payload structure.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `transformConversationAssignment` function to handle various field name variations
- Added proper logging to debug data transformation
- Updated field mapping to handle both camelCase and PascalCase properties

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/live-agent-interface/src/store/slices/conversationSlice.ts`

### 3. **Chatbot Widget Event Handling** ✅
**Problem**: The chatbot widget was looking for incorrect field names in the assignment payload.

**Solution**:
- Simplified the field extraction logic to match the standardized backend payload
- Enhanced logging for better debugging
- Fixed agent name extraction logic

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/chatbot-widget/src/services/websocket.ts`

### 4. **Live Agent Interface Event Processing** ✅
**Problem**: The live agent interface wasn't properly processing conversation assignments in real-time.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced ConversationsPage to handle assignment events properly
- Added conversation ID fallback handling for different property name cases
- Integrated assignment handling into DashboardPage for real-time stats updates

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/live-agent-interface/src/pages/conversations/ConversationsPage.tsx`
- `frontend/live-agent-interface/src/pages/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx`

## Backend Payload Structure (Standardized):

```json
{
  "ConversationId": "guid",
  "AgentId": "guid", 
  "AgentName": "Agent",
  "CustomerName": "Customer Name",
  "CustomerEmail": "customer@email.com",
  "Subject": "Conversation Subject",
  "Language": "en",
  "Status": "active",
  "Timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Frontend Event Handlers:

### Chatbot Widget:
- ✅ Properly extracts AgentId and AgentName
- ✅ Updates conversation status to "active"
- ✅ Adds system message about agent joining
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging

### Live Agent Interface:
- ✅ Transforms assignment data to conversation object
- ✅ Updates conversation list in real-time
- ✅ Fetches detailed conversation data
- ✅ Updates dashboard statistics
- ✅ Handles various property name cases (camelCase/PascalCase)

## Testing Checklist:

### Backend Testing:
- [ ] Start ChatRuntimeService and LiveAgentService
- [ ] Check logs for ConversationAssigned events being sent
- [ ] Verify payload structure matches specification

### Chatbot Widget Testing:
- [ ] Start a conversation
- [ ] Request agent assistance 
- [ ] Check browser console for "SignalR: ConversationAssigned event received"
- [ ] Verify agent appears in UI
- [ ] Confirm system message shows agent joining

### Live Agent Interface Testing:
- [ ] Login as agent
- [ ] Check dashboard for incoming conversations
- [ ] Accept a conversation
- [ ] Verify conversation appears in conversations list
- [ ] Check console for assignment event logs
- [ ] Confirm dashboard stats update

## Common Issues to Watch For:

1. **Property Name Mismatches**: Backend sends PascalCase, frontend expects camelCase
2. **Missing Customer Information**: Ensure conversation data includes customer details
3. **Event Handler Registration**: Handlers should be registered when SignalR connects
4. **Group Membership**: Agents must join appropriate SignalR groups to receive events

## Next Steps:
1. Test the flow end-to-end
2. Monitor browser and server logs during conversation assignment
3. Verify real-time updates work correctly
4. Consider adding agent name lookup from user service in the future
